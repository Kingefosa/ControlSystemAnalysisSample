## Introduction

Welcome to the Control System Analysis Sample application! This tool is designed to help you understand and analyze control systems. Whether you're a student studying control theory, an engineer working on control systems, or a researcher in the field, this sample application provides practical examples and interactive tools to explore control system concepts.

Control System Analysis Sample offers an intuitive and interactive environment for studying control systems, simulating different control strategies, and analyzing system responses. You can use it for learning, prototyping, or as a reference for control system-related projects.

## Features

- **System Modeling**: Create mathematical models of control systems, including transfer functions and state-space representations.

- **Controller Design**: Design controllers for different control strategies, such as PID controllers or state feedback controllers.

- **System Simulation**: Simulate control system responses and observe time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics.

- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualize system responses and control actions in real-time.

- **Analysis Tools**: Analyze system stability, transient response, and frequency response.

- **Export and Share**: Save system models, simulation results, and analysis data for further study or collaboration.
